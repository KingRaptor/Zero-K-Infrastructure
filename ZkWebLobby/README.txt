The project contains custom steps to build the site part with node.

Since most of the time you won't need to make any changes in the C# code, you're
encouraged to run "npm run watch" in zkwl directory to make webpack host the
site on localhost and then launch the executable with
--url=http://localhost:8080. This is much more convenient than waiting for the
site to rebuild every time you run the project and rebuilding is much faster.
